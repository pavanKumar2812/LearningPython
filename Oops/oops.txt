oops - Object oriented programming
oops has the four pillars
we are all must aware of
=> Encapsulation
=> Abstraction
=> Inheritance
=> Polymorphism

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a mechanism that restrict the direct access to some attributes

Abstraction: A process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user

Inheritance: Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
             Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
             Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name
              (but different signatures) being used for different types.The key difference is the data types and number
               of arguments used in function.

               Example of inbuilt polymorphic functions:

                # Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-
                # morphic functions

                # len() being used for a string
                print(len("geeks"))

                # len() being used for a list
                print(len([10, 20, 30]))
